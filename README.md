Description
The purpose of this project is to implement a light weight user-level thread (LWT)
scheduling system without the need to modify the Linux kernel. Your system must allow
the creation and concurrent execution of threads of control within a Linux task, in a true
preemptive manner. The LWT system must be capable of creating threads and
performing mini context switches to share the CPU time among the task threads, based
on the specified scheduling policy.

Please check out project description for detailed requirement.
See report for design and implementation.
